## Overview of Analysis 
Roza, a scientist on the search for the microorganism which provides the best alternative meat taste is completing a dashboard of all her volunteer's belly button bacteria cultures. This interactive dashboard allows the users to observe the top 10 bacteria cultures found in all volunteers, filter through the results for each individual, and observe the bacteria cultures by sample and the frequency at which the individual washes their naval.
